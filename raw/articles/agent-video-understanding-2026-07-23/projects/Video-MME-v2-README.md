## 👀 Video-MME-v2 Overview

In 2024, our [**Video-MME**](https://video-mme.github.io/) benchmark became a standard evaluation set for frontier models like Gemini and GPT. However, as model capabilities rapidly evolve, scores on existing benchmarks are saturating, yet a clear gap remains between **leaderboard performance and actual user experience**. This indicates that current evaluation paradigms fail to capture true video understanding abilities. To address this, we spent a year redesigning the evaluation system from first principles and now introduce **Video-MME-v2**—a progressive and robust benchmark designed to drive the next generation of video understanding models.

### 🌟 Key Innovations

* **Progressive Multi-Level Evaluation Dimensions**: We systematically decompose video understanding into a three-level progression from "finding information" to "modeling time" to "cross-temporal reasoning":
  * **Level 1 (Multi-Point Information Aggregation)**: Retrieves, extracts, and integrates multimodal cues (frames, audio, subtitles) scattered throughout a video.
  * **Level 2 (Temporal Understanding)**: Focuses on dynamic evolution and causal relations, requiring models to accurately capture state changes, action sequences, and event logic.
  * **Level 3 (Temporal Complex Reasoning)**: Requires combining multimodal temporal information with external priors (world knowledge, social commonsense) to perform complex reasoning tasks.
* **Grouped Non-Linear Evaluation Mechanism**: We organize questions into groups targeting "capability consistency" and "reasoning coherence". Each group contains 4 interrelated questions, and we adopt a non-linear scoring scheme where scores depend not only on individual accuracy but also on overall consistency and the completeness of the reasoning loop.
* **Rigorous Data Annotation and Quality Control**: We establish a comprehensive data annotation process involving 3,300 human-hours from 60+ experts.

You can find the dataset on Hugging Face: [MME-Benchmarks/Video-MME-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MME-Benchmarks/Video-MME-v2).

It contains **800 videos** (in 40 zip archives), **800 word-level subtitle files** (JSONL format with timestamps), and a `test.parquet` with **3,200 human-annotated question-answer pairs** (4 questions per video, organized into groups).

## 🔮 Evaluation Pipeline

📍 **Frames and Subtitles**:

There are a total of **800 videos** and **800 subtitle files**. Each subtitle file (`<video_id>.jsonl`) contains word-level entries with timestamps:

```json
{"text": "Hello", "start_time": 0.5, "end_time": 0.8}
{"text": "world", "start_time": 0.8, "end_time": 1.1}
```

With respect to the setting of adding subtitles, we provide two modes:
- **Concatenated**: All subtitle words are joined into a single text block and appended to the frame description.
- **Interleaved**: Subtitle words are matched to their corresponding time intervals between adjacent frames, providing temporally aligned context.

📍 **Prompt**:

The common prompt used in our evaluation follows this format:

```
These are the frames of a video.
This video's subtitles are listed below:
[Subtitles]
Select the best answer to the following multiple-choice question based on the video.
Respond with only the letter (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H) of the correct option.
Question: [Question]
[Options A-H]
```

For the subtitles-free setting, the subtitle content is removed. For the thinking/reasoning setting, the instruction is replaced with:

```
Please perform a detailed reasoning based on the provided video frames to answer the following
multiple-choice question selecting the best option from A through H and providing your final
response strictly in the format: 'Final Answer: <letter>.
```

The script supports **automatic resumption** — if interrupted, simply re-run the same command and it will pick up from where it left off. Results are periodically saved every 50 questions. After inference, it automatically runs evaluation and outputs per-level scores, relevance/logic breakdowns, and fine-grained capability ratings.

📍 **Scoring**:

Video-MME-v2 uses a **grouped non-linear scoring** mechanism. Questions are organized into groups of 4, and each group is scored based on either:
- **Relevance** (capability consistency): An exponential score map based on the number of correct answers within the group.
- **Logic** (reasoning coherence): A chain-based score that rewards consecutive correct answers, respecting the dependency structure within the group.

The evaluation does not require any third-party models (e.g., GPT) — answer extraction uses regex matching by default.

> **Representative Results on the Leaderboard.** *w. sub* = with subtitle/audio; *wo sub* = without subtitle/audio (visual frames only). For Omni models that accept raw audio (e.g., MiMo-v2-Omni, Gemini-3-Pro), as well as the human baseline, we report results with raw audio input under the *w. sub* setting. This table presents a curated subset of models; for the complete leaderboard, please visit our [Project Page-Leaderboard](https://video-mme-v2.netlify.app/#leaderboard).

We conduct systematic evaluations on leading video MLLMs, revealing several critical insights:

### 1. Advantage of Non-Linear Scoring

<p align="center">
    <img src="Imgs/table2.png" width="90%">
</p>

> **Avg Acc vs. Non-Lin Score.** The gap and the ratio reflect robustness: whether a model can answer multiple correlated questions correctly within the same group.

* **1. Within-model comparison:** Gemini-3-Pro and Gemini-3-Flash reach average accuracy of 66.1% and 61.1% respectively—well above passing level. Under our group-based non-linear scoring, however, their scores are 49.4% and 42.5%. This shows that even SOTA models rarely answer all related questions in a group correctly. Our non-linear design exploits the group structure and reduces sensitivity to "scattered hits."
* **2. Cross-model comparison:** The ratio Non-Lin Score / Avg Acc reflects how much a model "drops" from single-question correctness to group-stable correctness, and thus indicates robustness. For example, Gemini-3-Pro has a ratio of about 75%, Doubao-Seed-2.0-Pro-260215 about 72%, while InternVL3-5-241B-A28B-Instruct is about 56%, and smaller models such as LLaVA-Video-7B are only about 40%. A lower ratio means the model more often gets only some questions right within a group—weaker stability and robustness. Non-linear scoring thus better reflects true capability and reveals model robustness.

### 2. Effect of Thinking Mode on Video-MME v2

<p align="center">
    <img src="Imgs/scientific_think_effect_v2.png" width="100%">
</p>

> **Effect of Thinking Mode on Video-MME-v2.** Performance changes under with-subtitle vs. without-subtitle settings across levels and overall.

* **1. Text modality helps unlock reasoning:** Overall, enabling Thinking with subtitles tends to yield more stable gains, while without subtitles the benefit is often smaller or can even turn negative. For example, Qwen3.5-122B-A10B gains +3.8 with no subtitle and +5.8 with subtitle on overall score. This suggests that explicit semantic cues from text make it easier for the model’s Thinking ability to be fully utilized.
* **2. Current Thinking mode can still cause regression:** Besides the general pattern that subtitles help Thinking, we still observe clear regressions for some settings, especially without subtitles. For example, Qwen3-VL-8B shows -0.6 without subtitle on overall score, while KimiVL-16B drops by -3.3 / -3.3 (no / with subtitle), and on Level 3, where Thinking matters most, it further drops by -4.0 / -3.9. This shows that the current Thinking mechanism in video MLLMs does not always bring positive benefit on video understanding tasks and still has substantial room for improvement.

### 3. Capability Radar

<p align="center">
    <img src="Imgs/radar_second_head.png" width="100%">
</p>

> **Capability Radar Across Video-MME-v2 Dimensions.** Model comparisons across fine-grained capability dimensions. This radar chart presents partial results; for more fine-grained performance analysis across a wider range of models, please visit our [Project Page-Analysis](https://video-mme-v2.netlify.app/#analysis).

* **1. Significant gain from audio:** On the Frames & Audio dimension, Gemini-3-Pro shows a relatively high peak, indicating stronger cross-modal alignment and integration when processing synchronized visual and audio information. In contrast, models that rely more on visual frames (e.g. GPT-5 and the Qwen family) are relatively weaker, reflecting differences in deep multimodal fusion.
* **2. Long-horizon temporal reasoning advantage:** On capabilities such as Order and Video-Based Knowledge Acquisition, which rely on long-horizon temporal modeling and cross-segment reasoning over long video frames, Gemini-3-Pro also maintains a large lead, indicating more robust long-context and temporal modeling, and better ability to integrate and reason over information across segments in long videos.
* **3. Clear room for improvement:** Overall, even as a SOTA model, Gemini-3-Pro still has significant room for improvement on each dimension. In particular, on Action & Motion and Physical World Reasoning, scores remain below 30, reflecting that current models still need to strengthen fine-grained action semantics and physical-world reasoning.
