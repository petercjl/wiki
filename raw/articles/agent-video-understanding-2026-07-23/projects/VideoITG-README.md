While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown significant potential in multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, efficiently selecting the most informative frames from videos remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce **Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG)**, a framework that adaptively customizes frame sampling strategies based on user instructions. VideoITG is supported by **VidThinker**, an automated annotation pipeline that (1) generates instruction-conditioned clip captions, (2) retrieves relevant video segments with instruction-guided reasoning, and (3) performs fine-grained frame localization. Using VidThinker, we build the **VideoITG-40K** dataset with **40K videos and 500K temporal grounding annotations**. Our plug-and-play VideoITG model leverages Video-LLMs' visual-language alignment and reasoning for discriminative frame selection, consistently improving performance across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks.

## Inference

### Checkpoint
- **VideoITG checkpoint (Top‑K selector)**: `nvidia/VideoITG-8B` ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/VideoITG-8B))

### How frame selection works (512 → sort → Top‑K)
Our VideoITG selector **scores 512 sampled frames** (default in scripts) with a sigmoid head, **sorts frames by score (descending)**, then selects the **Top‑K** most relevant frames. For downstream usage, we typically **sort the selected frame indices in ascending order** (chronological) before feeding them into a Video-LLM.

You can directly refer to the provided inference reference implementation: [`infer.py`](infer.py).

### JSONL outputs explained
There are **two** JSONL files commonly used in this repo:

1) **Grounding output** (`results.jsonl` written by `--model videoitg`)
   - Default path: `${output_dir}/results.jsonl` (see `output_dir` in `scripts/eval_lmms_eval/videomme_grounding.sh`)
   - Each line is a JSON dict containing (key fields):
     - `doc_id`: sample id in the benchmark split
     - `video_path`: video path used by the task loader
     - `contexts`: the full prompt used for scoring
     - `index`: a list of **frame indices ordered by score (descending)** (mapped back to original video frame ids)
     - `logits`: the corresponding **sorted scores** (same order as `index`, rounded to 2 decimals)

   Example (one line):
```json
{"doc_id": 12, "video_path": "...", "index": [120, 60, 180], "logits": [0.98, 0.97, 0.95]}
```

2) **Frame indices file** (`frame_indices_jsonl` consumed by downstream Video-LLMs)
   - Used by models like InternVL / Qwen3-VL / Eagle (see `frame_indices_jsonl` in `scripts/eval_lmms_eval/*.sh`)
   - Format: each line is:
```json
{"doc_id": 12, "index": [60, 120, 180]}
```
   - Here, `index` should be the **selected Top‑K frame indices** for that `doc_id` (usually sorted ascending for chronological order).

## Training Data

### VideoLLM Data
For VideoLLM training, we use the same data and strategy as LLaVA-Video, including the [Pretraining Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K), [OV SFT Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-OneVision-Data) and [LLaVA-Video Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K).


### VideoITG Data


## Checkpoint Preparation
We recommend using the VideoLLM checkpoints we provided [here](https://huggingface.co/exiawsh/eagle-qwen2-7b-finetune-uni-ov-video-finetune-sftv1) to reproduce our results.

## Training
You can train the model following:

```bash
bash scripts/videoitg/finetune-uni-64frame-qwen2-7b-grounding.sh finetune 16
```

In default we use 128 NVIDIA A100 80G GPU to conduct the training. Please modify the `per_device_train_batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` if you are using different amount of GPUs. The training for VideoITG requires 4 hours.

### Notes
If you have limited GPU resources or memory, please considering the following:

- use gradient accumulation and reduce the per-device batch size

## Evaluation

### Evaluation with LMMs-Eval
For evaluation, we use Videomme as an example.
First, using this command to run our VideoITG model and get the instructed grounding results.

```bash
bash scripts/eval_lmms_eval/videomme_grounding.sh
```

After running this command, a .jsonl file containing the scores for each frame will be generated in the output directory output_dir=./videomme_result_512. We will select $K$ frames from these files to be used for inference with the downstream VLM.

Taking the InternVL2.5 model as an example, run the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/eval_lmms_eval/internvl2.5.sh
```
Before running the script, you first need to fill in the path of the .jsonl file generated in the output_dir into the frame_indices_jsonl variable. Then, set num_frame according to your specific needs; for instance, if you want to select the top 32 frames, set num_frame to 32 in the script.

#### Script arguments explained
All evaluation scripts are thin wrappers around `lmms_eval` with `accelerate`. The key arguments are:

- `--tasks`: which benchmark to run (e.g., `videomme`, `mlvu`, `longvideobench_val_v`, `cgbench_subtitles`).
- `--model`: the evaluation backend (e.g., `videoitg`, `internvl2`, `internvl3_5`, `qwen3_vl`, `eagle2_5`).
- `--model_args`: comma-separated key-value pairs consumed by each `--model`.
  - **VideoITG grounding stage** (`--model videoitg`, see `videomme_grounding.sh`):
    - `pretrained`: HF repo or local path of VideoITG (default: `nvidia/VideoITG-8B`).
    - `num_frames`: number of uniformly decoded frames to score before selection (e.g., `512`).
    - `target_fps`: target fps used when extracting frames (e.g., `1`).
    - `output_dir`: where the per-sample frame scores `.jsonl` are written (e.g., `./videomme_result_512`).
  - **Downstream Video-LLM stage** (e.g., `internvl2.5.sh`, `internvl3.5.sh`, `qwen3_vl.sh`):
    - `pretrained`: HF repo of the downstream Video-LLM.
    - `frame_indices_jsonl`: the selected frame indices file (Top-K indices per sample), produced from the grounding stage output.
    - `num_frame` / `max_num_frames`: how many frames to feed into the downstream model (typically `32`).
    - `modality`: set to `video` for models that require it (e.g., InternVL / Eagle).
### Notes
In our paper, we report the results of CG-Bench mini, which includes 3,000 QA pairs.

If you want to evaluate Eagle2.5, please update transformers to 4.55.4 (but can't infer our VideoITG Model).
